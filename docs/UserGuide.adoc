== Introduction

K.N.S. AddressBook v1.3.0 is a free Java desktop application available on Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. It is
designed for telemarketers who are bound to their desks, making many calls to clients with the office's telephone.

Most of the interactions with the application are done through an in-built Command Line Interface (CLI), which allows
you do add, edit and remove contacts quickly with only the use of a keyboard.

This user guide will help you get started on using our application, and show you how you can make use of it.

== Key Features

=== Person Panel `In Development For v1.5`

This is where the details of a selected contact will be displayed. As of now, only the name, address, phone number and
tags are displayed here. Planned features for the Person Panel include:

* `For v1.5` Set contact's picture
* `For v1.5` Notes/Comments on the contact
* `For v1.5` Birthday Countdown
* `For v2.0` Birthday Reminder

=== Colour Theme Switcher `In Development For v1.5`

As of now, the dark theme is the default colour theme for the application. Planned features include:

* `For v1.5` Command to change the theme, e.g. `theme light`
* `For v1.5` 5 Preset Themes: Light, Dark (current default theme), Red, Blue and Green.
* `For v1.5` Detailed instructions for advanced users to make their own themes.

=== Saving the data

The Address Book's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any executable command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save manually.


== Getting Started

=== Installation

.  Do ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` release link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file into any folder that you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds as
such:

=== Warming Up

. There are 6 example contacts that are already pre-loaded in the Address Book. Clicking on any individual contact card
will select it, showing you the contact's details in the PersonPanel like so:
+
image::FirstTimeSelection.png[width="790"]
+
. Let's start off by getting rid of all these example contacts. Type the command *`clear`* in the command box at the
top, and press kbd:[Enter]. You should now see an empty Address Book as such:
+
image::FirstTimeClear.png[width="790"]
+
.  Now, you can add in your first contact! For example, type `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/JohnStreet
, Block 123, #01-01 b/01/01/1991 t/example` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter]. Click on the new contact; you
should see the following:
+
image::FirstTimeAdd.png[width="790"]
+
.  Uh oh! Looks like we did not type the correct name of the contact. To edit the name of the contact, type `edit n/
John **Dow**` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter]. You should now see the name change in the PersonPanel.
. It's time for John to be gone from your Address Book. Type `delete 1` and press kbd:[Enter] in order to remove him.
+
Congratulations! You have now mastered the basic commands found in the application. In order to have a better
understanding of all the available commands, you can check them out link:#Available-CLI-Commands[here].

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
